            <h2>Unreal Engine Programming Workflow</h2>
            <p>
                Below is a quick guide to programming with Unreal Engine if you have never used it before.
            </p>
            <div id="workflow-terms">
                <h3>Terminology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Actor:</b> An object that can be placed in the level (equivalent to GameObject in Unity)</li>
                    <li><b>Actor Component:</b> Component that adds additional functionality to an Actor</li>
                    <li><b>Blueprint:</b> A visual scripting language used to create game logic</li>
                    <li><b>GameInstance:</b> A high-level manager class for an instance of a running game</li>
                    <li><b>Widgets:</b> The term for UI components</li>

                <h3>C++ Compilation</h3>
                <p>
                    To compile C++ code in Unreal Engine, you can either using Live Coding or Build the Visual Studio Solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Live Coding:</b> This allows you to compile code while the game is running. This should be on by default, but
                    can be toggled in the Unreal Engine Editor by going to
                    <code>Edit &gt; Editor Preferences &gt; Live Coding</code>. Live Coding is the preferred method for quick changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Build Visual Studio Solution:</b> This is the traditional method of compiling C++ code. You can do this by
                    right-clicking the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Build". This will stop the game, compile the code,
                    and then restart the game.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    I personally disabled Live Coding and solely use the visual Studio Build Solution method, as it lets me
                    view errors in the Output Window. Disabling Live Coding lets you build through VS without needing
                    to close the Unreal Engine Editor.

            <div id="workflow-blueprints-cpp">
                <h3>Blueprints and C++</h3>
                <p>
                    In general, you will create a C++ class with exposed functions and properties that can be used in Blueprints.
                    The C++ files are broken down into two files:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>MyClass.h</code> file: This is the header file that contains the class definition and declarations of functions and properties.</li>
                        <li><code>MyClass.cpp</code> file: This is the implementation file that contains the actual code for the functions declared in the header file.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To expose a C++ class to Blueprints, you need to use the <code>UCLASS()</code> macro and specify the
                    <code>Blueprintable</code> specifier. You can then create a Blueprint based on that class and use it in the level.

            <h2>File Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The Drone Environment repository is structured as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Config/</code>: Where the project settings are stored.</li>

        <div id="brian">
            <h2>Brian</h2>
            <p>
                Brian is the missing person that the drones are searching for in the Drone Environment. Brian spawns based on 
                the difficulty level selected when the simulation starts. This is done within the <code>TargetSpawner</code> blueprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Brian has a tag to identify which difficulty level he is associated with: "Dev", "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard".
                When the user selects a difficulty, the following occurs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Delete all Brians without the associated "Difficulty" tag</li>
                <li>Choose 1 Brian out of the list of Brians with the associated "Difficulty" tag and destroy the rest</li>

                <h3>Map Dimensions and Coordinates</h3>
                <p>
                    Dimensions in Unreal Engine are in centimeters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coordinate system in Unreal Engine is different based on whether you are in Editor or Play mode.
                    In Editor Mode, there is an absolute world origin point at (0, 0, 0).
                    In Play Mode, the world origin point is where the <b>PlayerStart</b> actor is placed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coordinate values with respect to Editor Mode:

                    Coordinate values with respect to Play Mode:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>PlayerStart:</b> (0, 0)</li>
                        <li><b>Bottom Left:</b>(-47,000, 102,000)</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map is 227,000 cm wide and 195,000 cm tall, which is approximately 2.27 km by 1.94 km.
                    This ratio is used to convert world coordinates to the respective minimap and large map coordinates

            <h2>HUD Controller</h2>
            <p>
                The UI all starts with the <b>BP_HUDController</b> actor in the level.
                It is located in <i>Content/UI/BP_HUDController</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The HUD Controller is responsible for:

            <p>
                The HUD can be broken down into the following panels, which are switched between based on user actions:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>StartMenuPanel:</b> The main menu that provides a <i>Start</i>, <i>About</i>, and <i>Quit</i> button. This is the default panel on the start of the program</li>
                    <li><b>OptionsPanel:</b> A menu that contains a <i>Controls</i> and <i>Quit</i> button. This panel is switched to when the user presses 'Escape' while in the <b>ScenePanel</b> or <b>OverridePanel</b></li>

                <p>
                    The minimap is a texture-based representation of the landscape. The texture is based on an orthographic screenshot
                    of the landscape, which is then used to create a material that is applied to the minimap.
                    The texture is located in <i>Content/UI/MapUI/T_LandscapeMap</i>.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    The alternative method is to use a 2D Scene Capture with a Render Target. However, this method involved
                    rendering the scene with another camera, which is not ideal for performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core functionality of the minimap starts with <i>M_Minimap</i>. This is a material of <i>T_LandscapeMap</i> that
                    uses parameters to center and scale the minimap accordingly. It converts world coordinates to UV texture coordinates
                    based on the following formula:

                <p class="code">
                    <code>UV = &lt;UV<sub>x</sub> + TextureCoordinate x Zoom, UV<sub>y</sub> + TextureCoordinate x Zoom</code>

                <p>
                    ...where <code>UV</code> is a two-channel vector whose values are clamped between 0 and 1 and...

                <p class="code">
                    <code>UV<sub>x</sub> = (X - (WorldWidth / 2) - Origin<sub>x</sub>) / WorldWidth + TextureOffset<sub>x</sub> + ZoomOffset</code>

                    The icon widgets for the minimap are located in <i>Content/UI/MapUI/WBP_POI_Minimap</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points of Interest on the minimap include drone icons (blue circles) and waypoint icons (red diamonds).
                    Positions are calculated based on the following formula:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    <code>Coordinate<sub>x</sub> = (HUDController<sub>x</sub> - POI<sub>x</sub>) / WorldtoMapRatio<sub>x</sub></code>

                    <code>Coordinate<sub>y</sub> = (HUDController<sub>y</sub> - POI<sub>y</sub>) / WorldtoMapRatio<sub>y</sub></code>

                    <br>
                    <code>WorldtoMapRatio<sub>x</sub> = WorldWidth / MapSizeX x Zoom</code>

                    <code>WorldtoMapRatio<sub>y</sub> = WorldHeight / MapSizeY x Zoom</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a coordinate is calculated, we determine the angle in degrees by using:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    <code>Degrees = arctan(-Coordinate<sub>x</sub>, -Coordinate<sub>y</sub>)</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we determine the Render Translation of the coordinate on the circular minimap with the following formula:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    <code>RenderTranslation<sub>x</sub> = cos(Degrees) x CoordinateMagnitude</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>RenderTranslation<sub>y</sub> = sin(Degrees) x CoordinateMagnitude</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...where <code>CoordinateMagnitude</code> is the distance between the POI in minimap coordinates and the center of the minimap,
                    clamped between [0, 140] inclusive.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    There is an option where the minimap can hide an icon if it is not within the minimap view.
                    If the boolean <i>Is Static</i> is true, the icon will be clamped to the border of the minimap.
                    If <i>Is Static</i> is false, the icon will not hsow on the minimap if it is out of range.
                    Both drone and waypoint icons are set to <i>Is Static</i> true by default.

                <p>
                    Each instance of <b>WBP_POI_LargeMap</b> contains an array of texture coordinates that it has been to.
                    Every 0.1 seconds, we call <i>UpdateTrailPoints</i>, which will append the current position for up to 500 positions.
                    If the array exceeds 500 positions, we remove the position at the first index of the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to line up the trail points to match the icon position, we need to offset the current render translation position

            <h2>User Overrides</h2>
            <p>
                One of the core features of the project is the ability for the user to override drone behavior within the simulation.
                To do this, we implemented the ability to Add and Delete waypoints within the simulation. This can be done within
                the "Drone Control View", AKA the <b>OverridePanel</b> found in the <b>WBP_HUD</b> widget.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <b>OverridePanel</b>, there is a "Select Mode" section to the right of the large map. This section contains
                an <i>Add Waypoint</i> and a <i>Delete Waypoint</i> button. Override modes are defined under 
                <i>Content/UI/ENUM_OverrideMode</i>, and are tracked within the <b>WBP_HUD</b> widget.
            </p>
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/drone-environment/override-panel.png" alt="Override Panel">
            <p>
                The user overrides are implemented in the <b>WBP_LargeMap</b> widget, which handles the input events and updates
                the drone behavior accordingly.
            </p>

                    The mouse cursor will be the default pointer.

                <h3>Add Waypoint Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    If the user presses the <i>Add Waypoint</i> button, the override mode will be set to <i>Add</i>.
                    The mouse cursor will change to a plus icon, indicating that the user can add a waypoint by clicking 
                    anywhere on the large map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding a waypoint is performed when the <i>OnMouseButtonDown</i> event is triggered in the <b>WBP_LargeMap</b> widget,
                    which performs the following steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Convert absolute mouse position to local mouse position relative to the large map widget</li>
                        <li>Convert the local map position to world coordinates</li>
                        <li>Fire <b>BP_WaypointManager</b>'s <i>AddWaypointEvent</i> to handle adding a waypoint</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conversion from map to world coordinates is done by using the following formula:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    <code>World<sub>x</sub> = (MapPosition<sub>x</sub> - CursorOffset<sub>x</sub>) x MapToWorldRatio<sub>x</sub> - PlayerStart<sub>x</sub> - WorldOrigin<sub>x</sub></code>
                    <br>
                    <code>World<sub>x</sub> = (MapPosition<sub>y</sub> - CursorOffset<sub>y</sub>) x MapToWorldRatio<sub>y</sub> - PlayerStart<sub>y</sub> - WorldOrigin<sub>y</sub></code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>MapToWorldRatio<sub>x</sub> = WorldWidth / LargeMapSizeX</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>MapToWorldRatio<sub>y</sub> = WorldHeight / LargeMapSizeY</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    World<sub>z</sub> is calculated by creating a line trace from the 2D map position <code>(World<sub>x</sub>, World<sub>y</sub>)</code>.
                    The line trace starts far below the landscape and stops until we hit the landscape. This ensures that the waypoint
                    is snapped to the landscape.

                    <p class="note">
                        The Python client does not generate any new waypoints. The simulation only takes in the initial waypoints
                        defined in the LandscapeMap level.

                    <p class="note">
                        Waypoints are assigned as targets to the drones via a Priority Queue in the Drone Controller Python client.

            <h2>Points of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                The Points of Interest (POI) encompass the drones and waypoints in the Drone Environment level.
                Assets involving the icons and waypoints on the maps are located in <i>Content/POI</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a breakdown of the assets related to the POI:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>AC_POI:</b> An actor component attached to <b>BP_POI</b> actors in the level.
                        On <i>BeginPlay</i> and <i>OnWaypointInitialization</i>, this actor component calls
                        the <i>AddPOI</i> functions within the minimap and large map widgets.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>AC_POI_Data:</b> An actor component attached to <b>BP_POI</b> actors in the level.
                        This actor component is simply a data container that stores the ID value of a waypoint.
                        The ID value is updated within <b>BP_WaypointManager</b> when the waypoint is added.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>WBP_WorldWaypoint:</b> A widget component that contains the waypoint icon and a text 
                        box for displaying the waypoint ID in the level.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>BP_POI:</b> An actor that represents waypoints in the level. It contains the 
                        <b>AC_POI</b> and <b>AC_POI_Data</b> components, as well as a <b>WBP_WorldWaypoint</b> widget component.
                        <i>OnWaypointInitialization</i>, it will update the <b>WBP_WorldWaypoint</b> component to display
                        the waypoint ID contained in <b>AC_POI_Data</b>.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>BP_WaypointManager:</b> An actor that manages all waypoints in the level.
                        It contains events that are fired when there are user overrides or Python client updates involving waypoints:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>AddWaypointEvent</i>: Fired when a waypoint is added. IDs a set based on the total NumWaypointsCreated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>DeleteWaypointEvent</i>: Fired when a waypoint is deleted by the user in the large map. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>SpawnWaypointsEvent</i>: Spawns all waypoints with a tag in the level based on the difficulty selected by the user
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>InputAction SceneToggleUI</i>: Toggles the visibility of UI elements in the <b>ScenePanel</b>,
                                including the minimap and the WBP_WorldWaypoint widgets.
                            </li>
