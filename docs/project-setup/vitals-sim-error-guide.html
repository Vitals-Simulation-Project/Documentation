                These are a list of all of the errors that I (and the rest of the current team) have run
                into while working with the project. I go into detail what different errors mean, what 
                is causing them, and how to solve them.

                    </ul>
                    In the installer, install the following individual components:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (14.38 - 17.8)</b></li>
                    </ul>

                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-setup/error-guide/vs-installer-workloads.png" alt="VS Installer Workloads">
                <p>
                    All of these components are required to build a C++ Unreal Engine project.
                    Desktop Development with C++ is required to build Colosseum.

                <p>
                    Click Install. This will take some time (roughly 25GB)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is the problem: when you installed the <b>Desktop Development with C++</b> workload,
                    you installed the component <b>MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (latest)</b>.
                    You cannot get rid of this component, as it is required by many other components. However,
                    Unreal Engine does not like the latest build tools due to a security risk and requires you 
                    use a previous version. This previous version is the <b>MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (14.38 - 17.8)</b> component
                    you installed earlier as an individual component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make Unreal Engine use the previous version of the build tools.
                    Assuming Unreal Engine is already installed and has been run at least once, in your
                    Windows search bar, type in <i>%appdata%</i> and go to the folder location. This will
                    bring you to the <i>AppData\Roaming</i> folder.
                </p>

                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-setup/error-guide/appdata-folder.png" alt="AppData Folder">
                <p>
                    Navigate to <i>Unreal Engine/Unreal Build Tool</i> and open <b>BuildConfiguration.xml</b>
                    with a text editor and change it to include the following:
                </p>
                    <!-- Shift margin-left because pre takes into account indent of HTML document. -->
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code>
                            &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
                            &lt;Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration"&gt;
                                &lt;WindowsPlatform&gt;

                                    &lt;ToolchainVersion&gt;14.38.33130&lt;/ToolchainVersion&gt;
                                &lt;/WindowsPlatform&gt;
                            &lt;/Configuration&gt;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    The version number you see in the <code>CompilerVersion</code> and <code>ToolchainVersion</code>
                    tags are the specific version of the build tools you installed. This is the last supported
                    version that Unreal Engine will accept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you should be able to build a blank C++ Unreal Engine project. If you cannot,
                    ensure that the steps above are completed correctly.

                <p>
                    I did this with a fresh install on a brand new Windows 11 machine. I don't imagine
                    that the Windows version matters, but I have not tested this on Windows 10.

                <h3>Building Colosseum to Work with Unreal Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    If you followed the steps in the previous section, you will likely run into an error
                    detailing that the Unreal Engine and Colosseum versions do not match if you try to build
                    and run a project that uses the Colosseum plugin (like Blocks).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To tell Colosseum to build with the <b>(14.38 - 17.8)</b> toolchain, we need to modify
                    the <b>build.cmd</b> script. Open up the <b>build.cmd</b> file in a text editor and change
                    line 125 to the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code>
                            cmake -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -T v143 ..
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    The <code>-T v143</code> flag tells CMake to use the <b>MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (14.38 - 17.8)</b>
                    toolchain instead of the latest version (which is the default toolchain)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, run the <b>build.cmd</b> script like normal in the Developer Command
                    Prompt for VS 2022. Hopefully, you will see the toolchain version number
                    (<code>14.38.33130</code>) during the build process. Once it's finished building,
                    open the <b>Blocks.sln</b> file. Go to <b>Build</b> &gt; <b>Build Solution</b>, and
                    hopefully you will again see the toolchain version number
                    (<code>14.38.33130</code>) in the output window. Once the build succeeds, you are ready to go!

                <p>
                    Below is a list of errors that may occur when building and testing the Drone Environment project:

                <ul>
                    <li>~25 compilation errors that only occur in AirSim plugin</li>

                <h3>~25 AirSim Plugin Compilation Errors Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    This error was occurring after cloning the git repository. Previously, 
                    the repository was tracking the <b>Plugins</b> folder. However, from the error
                    explained above, you <b>NEED</b> to use the Plugins folder from your build of Colosseum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem was that Visual Studio was using git to track changes in the Plugins folder.
                    Even after deleting and replacing the Plugins folder, git still considered the Plugins "unchanged"
                    and would not compile the plugin. You would see in the Build Output
                    <code>[Adaptive Build] Files excluded from building: ...</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution was to simply stop tracking the Plugins folder in git. I added
                    <i>Plugins/AirSim</i> to the .gitignore file. <b>DO NOT TRACK PLUGINS IN GIT REPO!</b>
                </p>

            <div id="drone-environment-dll-solution">
                <h3><code>DroneEnvironment.dll could not be closed</code> Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three cases for why this might occur:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first case is that you are trying to Build Solution from VS while
                    the Unreal Engine editor is open and Live Coding is enabled. Live Coding 
                    allows you to perform a quick compile when modifying C++ files. However,
                    while it is active, you won't be able to do Build Solution from VS without
                    closing the Unreal Engine editor first.
                    <p class="note">
                        Personally, I disabled Live Coding so that in order to compile, I have
                        to run Build Solution from VS. This way, I can see the compilation
                        errors in the VS Output window instead of the Unreal Engine editor. To
                        do this, go to <b>Edit</b> &gt; <b>Editor Preferences</b> &gt; <b>Live Coding</b>
                        and uncheck <b>Enable Live Coding</b>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-setup/error-guide/live-coding-settings.png" alt="Disable Live Coding">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second case is interference from an antivirus program. An antivirus
                    program may be trying to scan the DroneEnvironment.dll file while it is being
                    built, causing the file to be locked. When this occurs, just disable your
                    antivirus program temporarily and try to build again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third case is when you encounter a crash during Play mode. Unreal Engine
                    will close an a popup will appear showing you the crash log. Keeping this log
                    open will prevent you from building the solution in VS until it is closed.

                    This specifically occurs in the Colosseum 5.2 release package.
                    The crash log will mention that a NULL pointer exception occurred at
                    <b>SimModeBase.cpp</b> on line 235.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily, this is an easy fix. Navigate to 
                    <i>.../Colosseum/Unreal/Plugins/AirSim/Source/SimMode/<b>SimModeBase.cpp</b></i>
                    <br>

                <p>
                    On line 229, change the <b>#if</b> directive to the following:
                    <b>#if ((ENGINE_MAJOR_VERSION > 4) || (ENGINE_MAJOR_VERSION == 4 && ENGINE_MINOR_VERSION >= 27))</b>
                    <br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Once corrected, save the file and copy this Plugins folder into 
                    <i>.../Colosseum/Unreal/Environment/Blocks</i>. Then, open the <b>Blocks.sln</b> file in VS and
                    do <b>Build &gt; Build Solution</b>. You should be able to play the Blocks project.

                <p>
                    Below is a list of errors that may occur when building Colosseum:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT does not exist</code></li>
                    <li><code>C Compiler Unknown</code></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="hkey-classes-root-solution">
                <h3><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT does not exist</code> Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    This error will pop up towards the end of the building Colosseum, when
                    <b>build.cmd</b> tries to Generate Visual Studio project files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that Unreal Engine is not associated with the Windows Registry yet.
                    This may occur if you have never opened Unreal Engine before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fix this, verify your Unreal Engine installation. In the Epic Games Launcher,
                    go to the <b>Library</b> tab, find the version of Unreal Engine you are using,
                    click on the three dots next to it, and select <b>Verify</b>.
                    Once the verification is complete, try launching Unreal Engine to let initialization
                    scripts run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, you should be able to run the <b>build.cmd</b> script again for Colosseum.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="c-compiler-unknown-solution">
                <h3><code>C Compiler Unknown</code> Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    After running the <b>build.cmd</b> script, you may see an error during the
                    <i>Build rpclib</i> stage that says the C compiler Identification is unknown and
                    that it cannot run a simple test program. Finally, it will say that there was some
                    link error where the script could not close a file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This error may also occur during Build Solution in VS. An error will generate
                    that says some .dll files cannot be closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve this, first ensure that you have the correct Visual Studio 2022 workloads
                    installed, as described in the 
                    <a href="#unreal-engine-cpp-project-fails-to-build">Unreal Engine C++ Project Fails to Build</a> section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the error still occurs, then it is likely your antivirus program. Try disabling your antivirus
                    program temporarily and then run the <b>build.cmd</b> script again.
                </p>
